#Flashcardr

A simple flashcard study aid designed as a way to build my python development skills and gain experience with the Flask framework. This is also an opportunity to dip my toes into the world of jQuery.

**ver. 0.2** - Set up SQLAlchemy and successfully queried db and passed values to the templates. Need to set up admin interface to handle loading of cards.
**ver. 0.1** - App runs successfully with a small test set. HTML, CSS, and jQuery interface up and running. No database.

Packages Used:

Flask
SQLAlchemy
Flask-SQLAlchemy
